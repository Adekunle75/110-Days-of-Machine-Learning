![Machine Learning Banner](https://www.fsm.ac.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ml-e1610553826718.jpg)

## Welcome to the 110 Days of Machine Learning Challenge! 

- You can either fork this repo or click this Google doc [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OI8wjBEIFagR5HJMQ51wtvkHZyErsMSCdQsdON8mQqo/edit?usp=sharing) to have your own checklist. 
- Make sure you store all your projects and findings in a GitHub repository
- Always celebrate your milestones and publicize your works

Also, note this challenge is supposed to be for 22 weeks. Thatâ€™s giving an allowance of 2 days weekly for rest and unwinding. 
Please try to observe the rest you need as you take on this challenge. All the best!

## FOR CONTRIBUTORS
- You can provide links to resources for learning and for projects (please indicate if the resources are free or paid)
- You can add new things (that aren't in the checklist) to learn under the 'BONUS' Days
